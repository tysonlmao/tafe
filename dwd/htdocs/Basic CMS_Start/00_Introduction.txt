[C3] BASIC CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM [BASIC CMS]

OVERVIEW
  - PREVIOUS: We created the session management needed to house our CMS System on
  - NOW: We will incorporate services into our Login System, to turn it into a proper content management system that offers a posting function, much like a Blog system used by WordPress

  - NOTE: Many steps we will write will begin to become repeatative or occur in more than one place.  That will help us remember the way we should be writing these scripts & our application!
