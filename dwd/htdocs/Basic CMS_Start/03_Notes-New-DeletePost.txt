[C3] BASIC CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM [BASIC CMS]
- NOTE: For most working notes on steps - see the relevant files which have notes under each step.  This is just an overall guide to help locate correct file at different stages!

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE TO TEST AFTER EACH MAJOR STEP!


E. DELETE POSTS FUNCTION (deletepost.inc.php)
  (0) NOTE: In posts.php, we set a url to deletepost.inc.php in our post admin button.  We will use this to fire the script to delete the post from the DB

  -- CREATE & GO TO deletepost.inc.php --

  (1) Check User is Logged In + Id passed in via GET
    -> NOTE: ESSENTIAL that user is logged in before they can delete (this is known as proper authorisation!) 

  (2) Restrict Access to Script Page
  (3) Connect to DB
  (4) Collect & store POST data
  (5) Check that data is an integer 
  (6) Delete Post from DB (Prepared Statements)
    (i) Declare Template SQL with ? Placeholders to delete values from table
    (ii) Init SQL statement
    (iii) Prepare + send statement to database to check for errors
    (iv) SUCCESS: Bind our user data with statement + escape integer
    (v) Execute the SQL Statement (to run in DB)
    (vi) SUCCESS: Post is deleted from "posts" table - redirect with success message

  -- GO TO posts.php --

  (7) Dynamic Error Message for DELETE
    -> NOTE: We break apart the previous scripts for our post display, as we want the success/error messages to appear BELOW the connection message.


[CLASS CHALLENGE]: Dynamic Success Message for CREATEPOST
  -> As discussed in 02-C, our successful creation of posts gets redirected to the POSTS.php page.  
  -> Using our previous examples as guidance, try to write in a success alert for the creation of a post JUST ABOVE the DELETE ALERTS!
  -> SOLUTION: Included in Basic CMS_Finished!
