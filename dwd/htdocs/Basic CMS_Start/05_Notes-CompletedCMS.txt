[C3] BASIC CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM [BASIC CMS]
  - At this point - we should have a mini working Content Management System - YAY!


G. TEST THE MINI-CMS APPLICATION
  - We want to test to make sure all major features are working:
    -> Logout
    -> View posts 
    -> Login 
    -> Create test post
    -> Check the link for URL
    -> Edit test post
    -> Delete test post
    -> Then try to break it to test its error handling!


H. CHALLENGES & ENHANCEMENTS:
  (a) Creating New Post with Additional Field
    -> Update DB to include additional field
    -> Display new field in view page
    -> Add to edit post page

  (b) Change Image URL to be an Image Uploader!
    -> CURRENTLY: We have just an external URL 
    -> We can use our image uploader application and merge that into this application, where it uploads the file & 

  (c) Improved Features in our UX
    (i) Error Message for no Rows in posts.php (currently just displaying a string)
    (ii) Adjust the Nav Menu to only Show Signup when Logged in
    
  (d) Improved UI on the Posts page to better show content
    -> Could incorporate better Bootstrap features such as row/cols to manage the spread OR optimise images better

  MAIN CONCEPT: Look to extend & enhance to help build your PHP and PROGRAMMING SKILLS!
