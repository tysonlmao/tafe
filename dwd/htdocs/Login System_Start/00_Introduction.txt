[C2] LOGIN SYSTEM

OVERVIEW
  - HTTP by default renders web pages as "stateless", meaning on refresh or redirect, the website will forget the user and any information/data they presented
  - We will create a "stateful" application by creating sessions for the user, via a login system.  
  - This login system will need to encrypt the login data, being the password using hashing and salting
