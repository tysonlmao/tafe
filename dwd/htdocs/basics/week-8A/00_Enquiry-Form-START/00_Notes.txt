[B4] ENQUIRY FORM
- NOW with all the groundwork complete, we can start to build our first PHP applications!

- IN GENERAL: This enquiry form will take some inputs, pass them via GET method to the URL & our php file to execute a series of commands that will eventually insert these values into our phpMyAdmin database!


SETUP STEPS:
A. Review the Form:
  - Make note of the structure & CSS (which is external BUT is internal in the solution)
  - Look at the general structure of the form, and in particular, ensure you notice the form method we have referenced ("GET") & the different variables we will be sending under the "name" attributes for each input field 
  - Importantly, the GET method will ensure the information from the form will get passed to the URL and to our php file for processing


B. Setup the Database
  - We need to go to phpMyAdmin and create our database & table, as we need to create the "boxes" that will accept the data we are sending via GET from the form
  - NOTE: To help, this folder has included the cheat sheet PDF with all SQL commands!

  (1) Create a database called "myFormDB", using SQL
  (2) Create a table called "myuserdata" with the following columns: "id" (primary key), "name", "email", "regards" & "subject" - all are varchar(255) except for the id 

C. Create & Write our submit.php script to connect & query the DB
  (1) Save our Database Config to Variables
  (2) Create connection variable with database
  (3) Check connection with DB
  (4) SQL Validation
  (5) Save SQL Command to DB
  (6) Issue our query to DB

AND THEN TEST!
